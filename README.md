This project is a chat and image caption generator that leverages the Google Gemini API and Streamlit. It offers two main features: a conversational chatbot and an image captioning tool.


## About Google Gemini API

The Google Gemini API is a powerful tool that enables developers to build applications that leverage advanced AI capabilities, including natural language processing and image recognition. It allows for seamless integration of AI functionalities into applications, making it easier to create intelligent systems that can understand and generate human-like responses or analyze visual content.
